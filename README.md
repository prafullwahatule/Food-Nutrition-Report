> An interactive health analytics dashboard built using Power BI to transform raw nutrition data into actionable dietary intelligence.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Food Nutrition & Dietary Insights Dashboard** is an end-to-end Power BI project designed to analyze daily food consumption patterns and evaluate overall nutrition quality.

This dashboard enables users to:

- Understand nutritional composition of food items
- Identify high-risk foods (High Sugar, Sodium, Cholesterol, Calories)
- Compare meal-type calorie distribution
- Plan diet based on weight-loss or muscle-gain goals
- Make informed, data-driven dietary decisions

The project demonstrates real-world data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard design applied to health analytics.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many individuals consume food without fully understanding its nutritional impact. Hidden risks like high sodium or sugar intake can lead to long-term health issues.

This project solves that problem by:

- Converting raw nutritional data into clear KPIs
- Highlighting risk-based food classification
- Providing goal-oriented insights (Weight Loss / Muscle Gain)
- Enabling dynamic filtering by meal type and category

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains detailed nutritional information for each food item, including:

- Calories (kcal)
- Protein (g)
- Carbohydrates (g)
- Fat (g)
- Fiber (g)
- Sugar (g)
- Sodium (mg)
- Cholesterol (mg)
- Food Category
- Meal Type (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks, Sides)
- Water Intake (ml)

🔹 A unique **Food ID** was created to ensure proper aggregation and data modeling.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Power BI Desktop**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- Data Modeling & Relationships
- Calculated Columns & Measures
- Interactive slicers
- Drill-down visuals
- Dynamic Image Rendering using Image URLs

---

## 🧮 Data Modeling

- Implemented star-schema-inspired structure
