# 🥗 Food Nutrition & Dietary Insights Dashboard (Power BI)

> An interactive health analytics dashboard built using Power BI to transform raw nutrition data into actionable dietary intelligence.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Food Nutrition & Dietary Insights Dashboard** is an end-to-end Power BI project designed to analyze daily food consumption patterns and evaluate overall nutrition quality.

This dashboard enables users to:

- Understand nutritional composition of food items
- Identify high-risk foods (High Sugar, Sodium, Cholesterol, Calories)
- Compare meal-type calorie distribution
- Plan diet based on weight-loss or muscle-gain goals
- Make informed, data-driven dietary decisions

The project demonstrates real-world data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard design applied to health analytics.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many individuals consume food without fully understanding its nutritional impact. Hidden risks like high sodium or sugar intake can lead to long-term health issues.

This project solves that problem by:

- Converting raw nutritional data into clear KPIs
- Highlighting risk-based food classification
- Providing goal-oriented insights (Weight Loss / Muscle Gain)
- Enabling dynamic filtering by meal type and category

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains detailed nutritional information for each food item, including:

- Calories (kcal)
- Protein (g)
- Carbohydrates (g)
- Fat (g)
- Fiber (g)
- Sugar (g)
- Sodium (mg)
- Cholesterol (mg)
- Food Category
- Meal Type (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks, Sides)
- Water Intake (ml)

🔹 A unique **Food ID** was created to ensure proper aggregation and data modeling.

---

## 📈 Key Metrics & DAX Calculations

### Core KPIs

- Average Calories
- Average Sugar
- Total Protein
- Total Carbohydrates
- Health Score (Custom Weighted Metric)
- Healthy Food Percentage

### Risk Indicators

- High Sugar Flag
- High Sodium Flag
- High Cholesterol Flag
- High Calorie Indicator

### Goal-Based Classification

- Weight Loss Friendly Food
- Muscle Gain Friendly Food
- Low Sodium Recommendation Indicator

All metrics dynamically respond to:

- Meal Type slicer
- Food Category filter
- Food Item selection

---

## 📑 Report Structure

The dashboard is divided into 4 analytical layers:

### 🏠 1. Home
- High-level KPI summary
- Overall nutrition snapshot
- Quick health assessment

### 📊 2. Overview
- Macronutrient distribution
- Meal-type calorie comparison
- Category-level breakdown

### 🔍 3. Deep Analysis
- High-risk food identification
- Sugar, Sodium, Cholesterol concentration analysis
- Unhealthy pattern detection

### ❤️ 4. Health Insights
- Weight Loss Friendly Foods
- Muscle Gain Support Foods
- Sodium Awareness Insights
- Personalized goal-oriented filtering

---

## 📊 Key Insights Generated

### 🥗 Nutrition Quality
- Most foods fall under moderately healthy range.
- Balanced distribution between light and heavy meals.

### ⚠️ Risk Patterns
- Snacks contribute disproportionately high sugar.
- Dinner contributes highest calorie intake.
- Processed & grain-based foods dominate carbohydrate contribution.

### ❤️ Health Observations
- Many foods qualify as weight-loss friendly.
- Protein-dense options are limited.
- High sodium presence across multiple meal types.
